    The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of
    positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
    Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

                        Explanation:
                        1   (0 0 0 1)
                        4   (0 1 0 0)
                               â†‘   â†‘

       Hamming Distance for example above = 2
